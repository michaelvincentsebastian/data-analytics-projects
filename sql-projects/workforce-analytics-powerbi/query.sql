-- Insight: This helps detect underpaid roles that may require HR attention.
SELECT 
  es.occupation,
  COUNT(*) AS total_employee,
  ROUND(AVG(es.salary), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM employee_salary es
GROUP BY es.occupation
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;

-- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Data Quality Check ‚Äì Missing Department

WHERE dept_id IS NULL;

-- üë• 3. Gender Distribution by Department
-- Objective: Understand the gender composition across departments for diversity assessment.
-- Insight: Useful for promoting gender balance in the workplace.
SELECT 
  d.department_name,
  ed.gender,

FROM employee_salary es
JOIN employee_demographics ed ON es.employee_id = ed.employee_id
JOIN parks_departments d ON es.dept_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name, ed.gender;

-- üßì 4. Average Age and Salary by Department
-- Objective: Assess both experience (age) and compensation levels across departments.

JOIN parks_departments d ON es.dept_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name;

-- üèÜ 5. Top 3 Highest-Paid Employees
